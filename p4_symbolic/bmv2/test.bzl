"""Rules for testing BMv2 parser.

This file contains rule definitions for running
the test binary to produce output json and protobuf files,
subset diff the input and output json files, and golden file
testing the output protobuf files against the expected files.
It also defines a Macro that simplifies defining a protobuf test
over a sample P4 program.

        Computes a smart subset diff between two JSON objects.

        A subset diff is defined as follows:
        1. We allow every sub-dict in the expected file to contain additional
        keys that the actual file does not contain, but not the other way
        around. This should hold recursively.
        2. For leaf fields present in both files, that are primitive types
        (e.g. strings or numbers), their values must be equal.
        3. Corresponding lists must have the same number of elements (no
        sublists), and corresponding elements (index-wise) must satisify the
        subset relation.
        4. Finally, null/undefined values in the expected files are accepted
        to be equal to default values in actual of their respective types
        (e.g. "", []).

        Rational:
        1. Our protobuf definitions being tested here are incomplete: we
           intentionally ignore certain fields that are not useful to our tool.
           This means that in many cases, actual != expected.
        2. This behavior is not exhibited with lists: either protobuf parses
           the entire list when its part of the definition, or ignores it
           completely if it is not defined.
        3. Any null values in the expected json is parsed by protobuf as a
           default value of the corresponding type (e.g. 0 for ints). Our
           tool can either find out that the default value is a placeholder
           for null using the context, or does not exhibit a semnatic difference
           between null and the default value for the particular field.

        This rule takes a single argument: input.
        This is the json input file, or a rule that produces this json input
        file. The rule passes this input file in to the compiled
        p4_symbolic/main.cc which parses it with protobuf and then dumps it
        back to JSON.

        The rule checks that the dumped output (called actual) is a proper
        subset of the input (called exact).
