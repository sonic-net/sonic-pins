"""Test rules for IR

This file contains rule definitions for running the test binary to produce
output json and protobuf files, subset diff the input and output json files, and
golden file testing the output protobuf files against the expected files.
It also defines a Macro that simplifies defining a protobuf test over a sample
P4 program.

    The macro defines these rules in order:
    1. A rule for producing bmv2 json and p4info files from a .p4 file using p4c.
    2. A rule for parsing the bmv2 json and p4info using p4_symbolic/main.cc,

    3. A rule for golden file testing of the protobuf output file against the
       specified expected file.

    depends on (e.g. by including them).
