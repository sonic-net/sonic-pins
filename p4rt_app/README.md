# SONiC P4RT App

The SONiC P4RT App is a gRPC service supporting the
[P4Runtime](https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime) interface for switches running
the SONiC operating system. This project is intended to be build and used by
[sonic-buildimage](https://github.com/pins/sonic-buildimage/tree/pins/202012_20210206/src/sonic-p4rt)

This is not an officially supported Google product.

This code is still a work in progress.
