# Gutil

This repository contains general-purpose utility functions that are currently
missing in (the open-source versions of) GoogleTest, Abseil, and Protocol
Buffers (e.g. proto matching, proto ordering, status matchers, test artifact
writers, etc).

This repository is meant to eventually go away, when better alternatives are
available directly in the mentioned libraries.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
