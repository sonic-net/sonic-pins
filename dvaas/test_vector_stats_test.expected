4 (57.14%) of 7 test vectors passed
For 7 (100.00%) of 7 test vectors SUT produced correct number & type of outputs
For 4 test vectors SUT produced at least one forwarded packet
For 3 test vectors SUT produced at least one punted packet
For 1 test vectors SUT produced no output packets
Overall, SUT produced 6 forwarded packets and 3 punted packets
None of 2 test vectors attempted had deterministically reproducible failures
